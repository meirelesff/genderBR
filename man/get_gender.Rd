\title{Predict gender from Brazilian first names}
\usage{
get_gender(names, state = NULL, prob = FALSE, threshold = 0.9)
}
\arguments{
\item{names}{A string specifying a person's first name. Names can also be passed to the function
as a full name (e.g., Ana Maria de Souza). \code{get_gender} is case insensitive.}

\item{state}{A string with the state of federation abbreviation (e.g., \code{RJ} for Rio de Janeiro).}

\item{prob}{Report the proportion of female uses of the name? Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric indicating the threshold used in predictions. Defaults to 0.9.}
}
\value{
\code{get_gender} may returns three different values: \code{Female}, if the name provided is female;
\code{Male}, if the name provided is male; or \code{NA}, if we can not predict gender from the name given the chosen threshold.

If the \code{prob} argument is set to \code{TRUE}, then the function returns the proportion of females uses of the provided name.
}
\description{
\code{get_gender} uses the IBGE's 2010 Census API to predict gender from Brazilian first names.
More specifically, it retrieves data on the number of females and males with the same name
in Brazil, or in a given Brazilian state, and calculates the proportion of females using it.
The function classifies a name as male or female only when that proportion is higher than
a given threshold (e.g., \code{female if proportion > 0.9}, or \code{male if proportion < 0.1});
proportions below this threshold are classified as missing (\code{NA}).

Multiple names can be passed to the function call. To speed the calculation process,
the package aggregates equal first names to make fewer requests to the IBGE's API.
}
\details{
Information on the Brazilian first names uses by gender was collect in the 2010 Census
(Censo Demografico de 2010, in Portuguese), in July of that year, by the Instituto Brasileiro de Demografia
e Estatistica (IBGE). The surveyed population includes 190,8 million Brazilians living in all 27 states.
According to the IBGE, there are more than 130,000 unique first names in this population.
}
\note{
Names with different spell (e.g., Ana and Anna, or Marcos and Markos) are considered different names.
Additionally, only names with more than 20 occurrences, or more than 15 occurrences in a given state,
are considered by the IBGE's API.

\examples{
\donttest{
# Use get_gender to predict the gender
# of a person based on her/his first name
get_gender('mario')
get_gender('Maria da Silva Santos')
get_gender('MARIA DA SILVA SANTOS')

# It is possible to filter results by state
get_gender('ana', state = 'sp')

# To change the employed threshold
get_gender('ariel', threshold = '0.8')

# Or to get the proportion of females
# with the name provided
get_gender('iris', prob = TRUE)

# Multiple names can be predict at the same time
get_gender(c('joao', 'ana', 'benedita', 'rafael'))

# In different states
get(rep('cris', 3), c('sp', 'am', 'rs'))
