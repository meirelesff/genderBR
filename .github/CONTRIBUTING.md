## How to contribute

### Reporting bugs and making suggestions

If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please **open an issue first**. This allows us to discuss the problem or feature request and collaborate on the best solution before any code is written.

### Pull requests

Pull requests are welcome! To submit a PR:

1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your feature or fix, making sure to describe the changes you plan to make.
3.  Make your changes, if possible including tests and documentation updates.
4.  Submit a pull request ensuring you document your changes clearly.

After submission, maintainers will review your PR and may suggest changes or improvements before merging. If your PR is accepted, it will be merged into the main branch and credited to you.

### Basic coding guidelines

-   **Avoid dependencies**: please try to avoid adding new dependencies to the package unless absolutely necessary.
-   **Best practices**: Adhere to best R coding practices (e.g., proper documentation, consistent style).
